# Buy-Side Framing — Vocabulary Mapping

The same Regen AI infrastructure serves both supply-side (project developers) and buy-side (CSOs, corporate sustainability, investors). The difference is framing, not technology.

## Vocabulary Mapping

| Supply-Side Term | Buy-Side Equivalent | Why It Matters |
|-----------------|--------------------|----|
| Credit Class Mapping | Portfolio Assessment | Buyers evaluate credit quality across portfolios, not individual registrations |
| Readiness Score | Due Diligence Score | Risk-weighted: includes counterparty risk, permanence, additionality |
| Governance Review | Risk Assessment | Buyers care about governance as risk reduction, not process |
| Verification Plan | Compliance Roadmap | Framed as regulatory readiness, not MRV protocol design |
| Partnership Opportunities | Engagement Recommendations | "Here's what to look for" not "here's what to build together" |
| Deal Dossier | Investment Thesis | First section = financial rationale, not relationship history |
| Discovery Sprint | Due Diligence Package | Deliverable = buy/don't-buy recommendation with evidence |
| First Credit | Anchor Position | First purchase in a credit portfolio |

## Key Framing Differences

### Supply-Side (Renew, Landbanking)
- **Question:** "How do I get my asset registered?"
- **Value prop:** Registry credibility + data anchoring + governance pathway
- **Dashboard focus:** Methodology alignment, gap analysis, sprint proposals
- **CTA:** "Schedule a discovery sprint"

### Buy-Side (CSOs, Investors)
- **Question:** "Should I buy these credits?"
- **Value prop:** Due diligence infrastructure + quality assessment + compliance evidence
- **Dashboard focus:** Credit quality scoring, risk assessment, portfolio fit
- **CTA:** "Request a due diligence package"

## Due Diligence Score (Buy-Side Readiness Score)

The buy-side score weights differently from the supply-side readiness score:

| Component | Supply Weight | Buy Weight | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Methodology quality | 30% | 20% | Buyers trust registry review, care less about details |
| Verification status | 20% | 30% | Buyers need verified credits, not in-progress verification |
| Governance completeness | 20% | 15% | Important but not the buyer's problem to solve |
| Permanence risk | 10% | 20% | Major buyer concern — reversal risk |
| Market liquidity | 10% | 15% | Can I trade this? |
| Data transparency | 10% | — | Buyers don't evaluate raw data |

## When to Use

- **Pre-Dave meeting:** If a buy-side inquiry comes before Dave provides full context, use the stub data file to show infrastructure capability
- **GreenBiz 26:** If speaking with corporate sustainability officers, flip vocabulary
- **Investor conversations:** Use "Investment Thesis" framing, not "Deal Dossier"
