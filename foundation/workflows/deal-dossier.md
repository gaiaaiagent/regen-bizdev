# Deal Dossier Workflow

Synthesize everything known about a prospect into a structured assessment for internal use. This workflow operates on client documents only — no MCP tool dependency required.

## Input

Client data directory containing any combination of:
- Prospect briefs / research notes
- Call transcripts (Otter.ai, MacWhisper)
- Alignment memos or partnership proposals
- PDFs, presentations, website content

## Process

1. Read all available client documents
2. Extract timeline of interactions (dates, participants, outcomes)
3. Identify client needs mapped to Regen capabilities
4. Flag open items and unresolved decisions
5. Assess risks to partnership success
6. Draft engagement approach and proposal outline

## Output Structure

## Why This Works

The deal dossier is the appetizer — it demonstrates surprising depth of preparation and earns attention for the registry-specific outputs that follow. It's impressive but not the differentiator. Move through it quickly in demos.
