# Ecological Knowledge Commons

_Team alignment document — not a client deliverable._

---

## Access Model

Three layers, stated clearly:

- **Public corpus:** 69,000+ documents queryable via KOI MCP, no auth required, open to anyone. Credit methodologies, governance standards, forum discussions, technical specs.
- **Private org data:** Internal team data and client-specific data are auth-gated and never shared. Engagement artifacts, proprietary methodologies, and internal analysis stay private.
- **Optional commons contributions:** Planned. Opt-in. Organizations choose what, if anything, to contribute. Default is private. Nothing is shared without explicit consent.

---

## Now vs Next

**Now:** Public KOI corpus + private auth-gated data per client. Each engagement is bilateral (Regen <> Client). No cross-client knowledge sharing. The public corpus is open to everyone; client work is private.

**Next:** Opt-in federated commons. Organizations that choose to share select methodology learnings and governance precedents (not raw data or proprietary methods) enrich a shared intelligence base. This creates network effects as more organizations participate. Each organization retains full control — they decide what to contribute, and can withdraw at any time.

## What

An ecological knowledge commons — shared methodology learnings, governance review precedents, and verification frameworks contributed by participating organizations. Not raw data. Not proprietary methodologies. The institutional knowledge that accumulates when organizations go through governance reviews, design verification frameworks, and build credit class integrations.

## Why

**Network effects create compounding value.** More participants means richer methodology comparisons, faster governance reviews, and more credible credits. Each new organization's work strengthens the foundation for the next.

**Openness differentiates from proprietary registries.** Verra and Gold Standard keep methodology knowledge siloed. Organizations go through expensive, slow review processes in isolation, with no way to learn from peers. A commons-based approach turns that isolation into collective intelligence.

**Alignment with Regen's mission.** Ecological credit markets should be transparent, collaborative, and open. A knowledge commons is the infrastructure expression of that principle.

## How

Federated knowledge sharing with sovereignty controls:

- Each organization controls what they contribute and what stays private
- Default is private — opt-in only
- Contributions are methodology learnings and governance precedents, not raw data
- Semantic knowledge graph with entity resolution enables meaningful connections across contributions
- Access controls per organization ensure data sovereignty
- Organizations can withdraw contributions at any time

## Principles

- **Knowledge sovereignty** — each organization controls what they share
- **Methodological transparency** — shared learnings strengthen the science behind ecological credits
- **Shared governance** — collective standards and governance precedents benefit all participants
- **Privacy by default** — nothing is shared without explicit opt-in consent

## For Clients It Means

Your work has value beyond your own credits. The governance review precedents you establish, the methodology alignment work you do, the verification frameworks you design — with your consent, these learnings can accelerate the path for other organizations building on similar credit classes. And their learnings come back to benefit you. The network gets smarter with every participant.

## Technical Foundation

- Semantic knowledge graph with entity resolution (shared concepts, methodologies, governance criteria linked across organizations)
- Federated sharing protocol with per-organization access controls
- Contribution tracking — organizations see what they've shared and can manage it
- Built on the same KOI infrastructure that powers the current knowledge graph

_Keep language general in client-facing contexts. No internal project references. Frame as "ecological knowledge commons" or "federated knowledge sharing" — general, descriptive terms that communicate the concept without tying to specific implementations._
