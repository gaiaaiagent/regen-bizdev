# Deal Dossier: Landbanking Group

## Executive Summary

Landbanking Group is a Munich-based natural capital fintech (founded 2022, ~$15M raised) that creates "Nature Equity Assets" — multi-dimensional nature outcomes packaged as investable assets via their proprietary "Landler" platform. Their key gap is **verification/MRV partners and registry infrastructure** to make these assets credible for institutional investors. Notable backers include Andre Hoffmann (Roche) and Prince of Liechtenstein, signaling institutional-grade governance expectations. The partnership opportunity is clear: Landler does the measuring, Regen does the governing and verifying.

## Relationship Timeline

| Date | Event | Key People | Outcome |
|------|-------|------------|---------|
| Pre-2026 | Initial ecosystem awareness | Gregory (Regen), Dr. Martin R. Stuchtey (Landbanking founder) | Mutual identification through regenerative finance / natural capital ecosystem; thematic alignment recognized |
| Jan 2026 | Two alignment memos produced | Regen BD team | **$REGEN Token memo:** Deep integration pathway involving token-level alignment. **Agile Tokenization memo:** Lighter-touch pilot using Regen's existing credit class infrastructure. Both memos analyzed for strategic approach. |
| Feb 2026 | Partnership analysis & demo preparation | Darren, Dave, Becca, Gregory (Regen) | Registry readiness analysis underway; demo targeting governance credibility for institutional investor audience |

## Alignment Memo Comparison

| Dimension | $REGEN Token Approach | Agile Tokenization Approach |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| **Core idea** | Deep token-level integration; Nature Equity Assets backed by or denominated in $REGEN | Use Regen's existing credit class framework to register and verify Nature Equity Asset components |
| **Commitment level** | High — requires token economics alignment, regulatory clarity, deeper technical integration | Low-to-medium — leverages existing Regen infrastructure with minimal custom development |
| **Time to value** | 6-12+ months; dependent on token regulatory framework | 8-12 weeks; can start with a single asset dimension (carbon via C01-C09) |
| **Risk profile** | Higher — token volatility, regulatory uncertainty, market timing | Lower — proven registry infrastructure, established credit classes |
| **Best for** | Phase 2+ after trust is established and first pilot validates mutual value | **Phase 1 — recommended first move** |
| **Investor signal** | Strong long-term commitment signal but may raise complexity concerns for institutional backers | Pragmatic, results-oriented — demonstrates value before deepening commitment |

**Recommendation: Lead with Agile Tokenization.** It proves value faster, uses existing infrastructure, and creates a foundation for the deeper $REGEN Token integration later. For Hoffmann and Liechtenstein-tier investors, demonstrated registry credibility matters more than token economics narratives.

## Client Needs Assessment

| Need | Priority | Evidence (from their words) | Regen Capability |
|------|----------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Registry credibility for Nature Equity Assets | High | Institutional backers (Hoffmann, Liechtenstein) need auditable, governed verification — not just self-reported metrics | Regen Registry governance: 4-stage methodology review, expert peer review, public comment process |
| Verification / MRV infrastructure | High | Listed as a "notable gap" in partnership ecosystem; no current MRV partner | `regen/data/v1` module — data anchoring, attestation, IRI resolution for verifiable ecological claims |
| Multi-dimensional asset registration | High | Nature Equity Assets span 5 dimensions (carbon, biodiversity, soil, water, social) — no single existing framework covers all | Multi-class credit issuance: C01-C09 (carbon), BT01 (biodiversity); new classes proposable for uncovered dimensions |
| Ecosystem legitimacy | Medium | In "narrative-building mode" — need association with credible registry infrastructure | Regen is the only registry with on-chain governance, transparent methodology review, and operational biodiversity credit classes |
| Proprietary index validation pathway | Medium | "Landler Biodiversity Index" is proprietary — institutional investors will question methodology independence | Registry review process provides independent validation pathway; expert peer reviewers evaluate scientific basis |

## Open Items & Decisions Pending

- [ ] **Nature Equity Asset → credit class mapping** — Owner: Regen BD team, Status: In progress. Which of the 5 dimensions map to existing credit classes, and which require new class proposals?
- [ ] **Landler Biodiversity Index validation** — Owner: Joint, Status: Not started. Proprietary methodology needs independent peer review documentation for registry submission
- [ ] **First pilot asset selection** — Owner: Joint, Status: Decision needed. Ritter Sport cocoa (strongest data), followfood regen ag, or African Parks conservation? Recommend cocoa — has existing corporate partner and clearest Nature Equity Asset structure
- [ ] **Dr. Stuchtey engagement** — Owner: Gregory/Dave, Status: Needs scheduling. First call to present partnership framework and registry readiness analysis
- [ ] **Agile Tokenization vs $REGEN Token decision** — Owner: Joint, Status: Recommendation made (Agile first). Needs Landbanking agreement on sequencing

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Landler Biodiversity Index rejected as too proprietary for registry standards | Medium | High | Pre-review simulation will identify specific documentation and validation requirements. Prepare evidence package early. |
| Multi-dimensional Nature Equity Asset doesn't map to existing credit class structures | High | Medium | This IS the opportunity — help design new credit classes. Carbon maps now; biodiversity partially maps; others are frontier. Frame gaps as partnership value, not blocking issues. |
| Landbanking prioritizes competing registry or verification partner | Low | High | Regen's unique combination of on-chain governance + biodiversity credit classes (BT01, USS01) + data anchoring is defensible. No competitor offers all three. |
| Institutional investor skepticism about blockchain-based registry | Medium | Medium | Emphasize governance process and verification standards, not blockchain technology. The chain is infrastructure, not the pitch. |
| Landbanking's own AI assistant ("Va") creates perceived competitive tension | Low | Low | Do NOT position this as an AI demo. This is registry infrastructure + governance, not AI capability. Landler/Va does measurement; Regen does verification. Complementary, not competitive. |

## Recommended Engagement Approach

Lead with **governance credibility and institutional verification** — this is what differentiates Regen for Landbanking's audience. Their investors (Hoffmann, Liechtenstein) care about auditability, standards, and independent verification, not technology novelty.

Frame the engagement as "exploratory, with clear learning goals" per Landbanking's own positioning language. Propose an 8-week sprint using the Agile Tokenization approach: start with the cocoa agroforestry Nature Equity Asset (Ritter Sport partnership), map it to Regen credit classes, run a governance review simulation, and produce a verification plan. This gives both sides concrete deliverables and a decision point for deeper engagement.

Critical tone: Strategic, governance-focused. Avoid AI demo framing (they have Va). Emphasize "Landler does the measuring, Regen does the governing and verifying."

## Talking Points for Dr. Stuchtey

1. **Registry credibility gap:** "Nature Equity Assets are innovative, but institutional investors need independent governance and verification. We provide that through a published, transparent methodology review process — the same kind of institutional rigor your backers expect."

2. **Complementary positioning:** "Landler measures and values natural capital. Regen governs and verifies it. Together, Nature Equity Assets become auditable, tradable, and credible for institutional capital."

3. **Start pragmatic:** "We recommend starting with your Ritter Sport cocoa agroforestry asset. Map the carbon dimension to our existing credit classes, simulate a governance review for the full Nature Equity methodology, and produce a verification plan — all within 8 weeks."

4. **Governance demonstration:** "Our methodology review process has four stages: submission, internal review, expert peer review, and public comment. We can show you exactly what that looks like for a Nature Equity Asset before you commit to a formal submission."

## Draft Proposal Outline

1. **Nature Equity Asset Registry Readiness Assessment** — Map all 5 dimensions of the cocoa agroforestry Nature Equity Asset to Regen credit class framework; quantify gaps; score registry readiness
2. **Governance Review Simulation** — Simulate the 4-stage methodology review for Landler's Nature Equity methodology; identify reviewer flags, required evidence, estimated timeline
3. **MRV Framework Design** — Data flow specification from Landler platform to Regen registry for all 5 dimensions; verifier types per dimension; monitoring schedule
4. **First Attestation Proof-of-Concept** — Anchor sample Nature Equity Asset data on Regen Ledger; demonstrate content hashing, attestation, and IRI resolution
5. **Credit Class Proposal Roadmap** — For dimensions without existing credit class coverage (soil, water, social), outline the pathway to propose new credit classes through Regen governance
