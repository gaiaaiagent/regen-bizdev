# Client Context: Landbanking Group

You have access to the following client-specific documents:
- Prospect brief (LandBanking_Group_Notes.txt)
- $REGEN Token alignment memo (landbanking_alignment_memo_REGEN_centric.pdf)
- Agile Tokenization alignment memo (landbanking_group_alignment_memo.pdf)

## Key Context

- Landbanking has the **"Landler" platform** with its own AI assistant ("Va") — do NOT position this as an AI demo
- They create **"Nature Equity Assets"** — multi-dimensional nature outcomes as investable assets
- Their key gap is **verification/MRV partners and registry infrastructure**
- Named partners: **Ritter Sport** (cocoa), **followfood** (regen ag), **African Parks** (conservation)
- Notable backers: **Andre Hoffmann** (Roche), **Prince of Liechtenstein** — institutional credibility matters
- They're in narrative-building mode — need ecosystem legitimacy
- Two alignment memos exist — **Agile Tokenization is the better first move** (lower commitment, proves value faster)
- Frame partnership as "exploratory, with clear learning goals"
- Founded 2022, ~$15M raised, Munich-based

## Demo Positioning

Start with the alignment analysis (deal dossier + memo comparison) to show strategic depth. The money shot is translating their Nature Equity Asset into Regen's credit class framework — showing that their multi-dimensional approach can map to a real registry with real governance. The governance review simulation demonstrates institutional standards that matter to Hoffmann/Liechtenstein-tier investors.

## Tone

Strategic, governance-focused. Landbanking cares about institutional credibility and investor confidence. Emphasize standards, verification, auditability. The partnership is "Landler does the measuring, Regen does the governing and verifying."
