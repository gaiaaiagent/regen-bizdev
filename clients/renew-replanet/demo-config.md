# Client Context: Renew/RePlanet

You have access to the following client-specific documents:
- Prospect brief (Renew_RePlanet_Notes.txt)
- Mar 2025 call transcript with rePLANET (Regen_Network_rePLANET_otter_ai.pdf)
- Jan 2026 call transcript with Renew (Regen_Renew_otter_ai.pdf)

## Key Context

- Renew wants Regen as **backend infrastructure** (not front-facing)
- Their methodology is **Wallacea Trust: 5 taxa, conservation-weighted scoring** (3D Forest Structure, Invertebrates, Breeding Birds, Bat Fauna, Higher Plants)
- Tech lead **Mark Moore** cares about: key management, API integration, developer support
- They are evaluating other options — we need to demonstrate clear technical value
- They stack biodiversity credits on top of Verra carbon credits
- Their model: landscape-scale ecological restoration with biodiversity metrics
- They work with **BFI (British Film Institute)** and other corporate partners who need independently verifiable ecological claims

## Demo Positioning

Lead with preparation depth (deal dossier), then pivot to the differentiator: mapping their Wallacea Trust methodology against Regen's actual credit class framework with live registry queries. The data anchoring walkthrough addresses Mark Moore's specific technical concerns about how their biodiversity survey data becomes verifiable on-chain.

## Tone

Technical, infrastructure-focused. Renew has sophisticated technical leadership. Don't oversell — demonstrate capability through outputs, not claims.
