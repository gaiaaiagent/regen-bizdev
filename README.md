# regen-bizdev

Business development toolkit for RegenAI custom agent service offering.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Download latest client data from Drive
python scripts/download_drive.py

# Set up Claude Desktop project for a client
# (see demos/ for project configs)
```

## What This Is

RegenAI creates bespoke AI agents for clients in regenerative finance. Each agent combines:
- **Regen domain knowledge** via KOI (Knowledge Organization Infrastructure)
- **On-chain data** via Regen Ledger MCP
- **Client-specific context** from their documents, transcripts, and data

The demo IS the deliverable - showing a client their own "Chief Everything Officer" that understands their domain.

## Current Pilots

- **Renew/RePlanet** - Nature data & restoration intelligence (UK)
- **Landbanking Group** - Natural capital fintech (Germany)
