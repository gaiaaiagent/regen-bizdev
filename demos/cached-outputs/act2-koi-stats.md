## Presenter Talking Points

> "Over 68,000 documents in a knowledge graph — credit methodologies, governance standards, technical specs, forum discussions, podcast transcripts, GitHub documentation. Not a static dataset. New content flows in automatically from 20+ data sources. When you become a partner, you'd get your own instance with sensors pointed at YOUR data sources."

**Note:** Document count grew from ~48K to 68K since initial validation. Update presenter notes to say "over 68,000" instead of "48,000+".
